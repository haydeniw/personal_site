							<p>The fall of my sophomore year (2018) I joined the team of teaching assistants (TAs) for my university's data structures course (Comp15) I began just by assisting in labs, grading homeworks/exams, and holding office hours to help students both conceptually and with debugging their code. I found that TA'ing students was incredibly rewarding and a passion of mine. I then was a teaching assistant again for Comp15 Spring of 2019, and then in the Fall of 2019 took on additional responsibilities within TA leadership for Comp15. These included meeting with professors and senior staff, leading exam review sessions, and leading labs. 
							</p>
							<p> After spending a while working with Comp15 students, I decided that I was interested in moving to the Intro to Computer Science course (Comp11). Since I had worked for several semesters with students who were not new to programming, I wanted to take a stab at working with many students who were totally new to it. I became one of the 5 Teaching Fellows for Comp11 (a course with around 300 students, 30 TAs, and 2 professors). In this role, I increased my duties and time around regular TA activities such as holding office hours, leading labs, leading review sessions, and grading homeworks/exams. Additionally, I was in charge of managing all the TAs homework grading to keep scoring consistent and timely. I worked closely with the professors and the rest of the senior staff to improve course infrastructure, especially moving office hours online when COVID-19 changed the structure of the course.
