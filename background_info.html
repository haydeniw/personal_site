							<p>In elementary school, I would sit in the computer lab for hours on end making games in Scratch. With two parents who were not technical, when I moved into high school and did not realize what coding was (I was completely unaware that was what I was doing in Scratch). I got deeply into graphic design (Illustrator, Photoshop, inDesign) and later found a passion for design with more advanced applications such as Blender for 3D modeling and animation. </p>
							<p> As I moved into Blender I began discovering scripting and was (re)introduced to coding by my graphic design teacher. I dabbled a bit in teaching myself some Python, but went out on a limb and applied for Girls Who Code's Summer Immersion program for the summer of my high school sophomore year. 
							</p>
							<p>Attending the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program (SIP) was what really pushed me to get more into development work. I was placed at Adobe Software in San Jose, CA for 8 weeks, which fit in nicely with my pre-existing interests in software. Not only did I get to create small projects in a variety of languages (Python, C++, Javascript) but I also got to create a final project and receive mentoring from both Adobe employees and interns. 
							</p>
							<p>After attending this program I decided I wanted to give back to the Girls Who Code community, so I founded a Girls Who Code club at my high school. I recruited a Google engineer to teach the club each Saturday and organized field trips to local companies. This allowed me to both get more people into coding and further pursue my own interest. The summer before my senior year, I wanted to get a headstart on college level programming so I took a community college course at Foothill College in intermediate Python programming. Through this course I gained more experience and fell in love further.
